[MR]Klaudia! Please, stop this![N]
I'm begging you![AN]
[ML]How many times must I tell you?[AN]
I won't stop, I *can't* stop, until[N]
Drek is defeated and the war is won![AN]
I don't care how dire the situation[N]
is, I have to fight![AN]
[MR]No, no you don't! You don't[N]
have to fight anymore![AN]
Evren is dead. Savitr is dead.[N]
Father is dead. The war is lost.[AN]
But we're still here.[AN]
It can be only us. Isn't that[N]
what you told Father:[AN]
that once the war ends you'll[N]
sweep me off my feet,[AN]
that once the war ends we'll[N]
leave this hellhole behind,[AN]
that once the war ends we'll[N]
be devoted only to each other.[AN]
[ML]Who are you to speak of devotion?![AN]
You[Beat] you betrayed everyone.[N]
You betrayed all our trust by[N]
surrendering to those bastards.[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes][Beat][OpenEyes][AN]
[ML]Why didn't you believe in me?![AN]
I was going to storm Castle Orsolle,[N]
kill Cassandra, and win the war.[AN]
I would've fulfilled my duty to[N]
Lord Fernyiges, and then[Beat][AN]
[ML]You were nothing but a tool to my father![AN]
He wanted you to win his war, then die for[N]
the sake of House Sarka's authority.[AN]
But I need you. I need you by my side,[N]
to support me, to cry on your shoulder,[AN]
to remind me that I was never alone![AN]
I love you, Klaudia, so please[Beat][N]
please, lay down your arms.[AN]
[MR][Beat]I'm sorry, but I can't.[AN]
I have to continue fighting, no[N]
matter what and no matter who.[AN]
Prepare yourself, Leviathan![A][X]

never hurt you, my beloved[Beat][CloseEyes][A][X]

[MR][MoMR]AHHH! Levia! No, no, nonononono![N]
This wasn't supposed to happen![AN]
Omen! Rami! Anyone, please, we[N]
need a healer in here![AN]
[ML]Klaudia[Beat] please, listen to me. I've[N]
been selfish, so very selfish.[AN]
I wanted you all to myself, but[N]
I've taken so much from you.[AN]
Could you ever forgive me?[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]Of course! Of course I forgive you![N]
Just hold on a litle while longer![OpenEyes][AN]
You have to promise me, Levia![AN]
[ML][Smile]It's a bit late for promises, wouldn't[N]
you say? But don't worry, it's alright.[AN]
[CloseEyes]That you could hold me in your[N]
arms at the very end[Beat][OpenEyes][AN]
[Beat]it's all I could ever ask for.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm sorry. Goodbye, my beloved[Beat][AN][ClearFace]
[MR][MoL]
[L]Levia! Levia! Speak to me, please![AN]
[CloseEyes]No[Beat] no[Beat] It should've been me.[N]
[OpenEyes]IT SHOULD'VE BEEN ME![AN]
What was the point?! What was the point,[N]
if I couldn't protect the woman I loved?![AN]
[CloseEyes]Levia[Beat] I failed you. I couldn't give[N]
the peaceful life you deserved.[AN]
But if my love eased even a fraction[N]
of your pain and solitude[Beat][AN]
then I hope you can forgive me.[AN]
Rest in peace, my beloved.[AN]
