## OvertureOpening
The land of Meraly was once a desolate[N]
wasteland unfit for sustaining life.[AN]
The few clans of humans who lived there[N]
were forced these by necessity,[AN]
pushed ever eastward by the growing[N]
lust for territory from the Empire of Drek.[AN]
These clans warred for generations over[N]
the scant few resources available,[AN]
polluting the already harsh terrain[N]
with freshly spilled blood.[AN]
But in their darkest hour, a savior[N]
descended on the despairing clans.[AN]
A group of mystics by the name of Sarka[N]
appeared from the east of Meraly,[AN]
channeling a sacred healing magic[N]
to bring life to the land's crags.[AN]
Meraly became a lush paradise,[AN]
and the clans gained newfound power[N]
to repel the invasions from Drek.[AN]
As thanks for restoring the land, each[N]
clan swore fealty to the Sarkans,[AN]
elevating their saviors to the new[N]
rulers of the continent: [Red]House Sarka[Red].[AN]
House Sarka appointed the various[N]
clan chieftains to act as vassals,[AN]
each of them ruling a new minor[N]
noble house in a Meralian state.[AN]
The most loyal and devoted of these[N]
chieftains went by the name Orsolle,[AN]
and for his service House Orsolle was[N]
made House Sarka's exalted retainers.[AN]
126 years have passed since then.[AN]
This story follows the journey of[N]
House Orsolle's current heir,[AN]
[Red]Klaudia Orsolle[Red], as she navigates a conflict[N]
that will shake Meraly to its core.[A][X]

## OvertureWolffiaTerritory
House Wolffia's territory, southeast Meraly.[A][X]

## OvertureKlaudiaArrives
[ML][LoadKlaudia][R][LoadOmen][FR][LoadJosephine]
[ML]How are you holding up, men?[AN]
I know this task was a sudden[N]
order from Lord Sarka himself,[AN]
but I appreciate your willingness[N]
to accompany me here. Thank you.[AN]
[R]Your lord father would never permit me to[N]
let you do this errand alone, milord.[AN]
[FR]It's not like I had a choice, you know.[AN]
If I'm to dance to your puppet strings[N]
for all eternity, don't thank me for it.[AN]
Why are we here, anyway? Nobody told me.[AN]
[ML]House Wolffia just requested assistance[N]
from Sarka to resolve a domestic dispute.[AN]
Lord Fernyiges sent me as envoy so I could[N]
gain practical negotiation experience.[AN]
There's a trade meeting now between[N]
House Sarka and the Empire of Drek,[AN]
and Father told me I could attend if[N]
I resolved this dispute quickly.[AN]
I need to start training now, as Father[N]
won't be around forever.[AN]
Now, let's begin investigating.[A][X]

## OvertureVillagerArrives
[FL][LoadOmen][L][LoadKlaudia][R][LoadOldWoman]
[R]Milord! Please, you must help us![AN]
[L]Calm down, ma'am. We've been sent by[N]
House Sarka to resolve a dispute here,[AN]
it would help us greatly if you could[N]
explain the situation.[AN]
House Wolffia has its own order of knights,[N]
why does House Sarka have to step in?[AN]
[R]The problem is the knights themselves.[AN]
A few days ago they came to collect the[N]
tribute, but told us we were short.[AN]
They accused us of withholding bottles[N]
of wine and threatened to arrest us![AN]
We always make our quota every month,[AN]
these knights are just lying so they[N]
can take some wine for themselves![AN]
[L]With all due respect, I don't see[N]
any issue here.[A] The knights exist to[N]
keep the peace and collect tribute,[AN]
there's no reason to assume ill intent[N]
on their part.[AN]
It's very likely you miscalculated the[N]
quota and the knights are correcting you.[AN]
I understand measurement may be difficult[N]
for one of your level of education.[AN]
[R]No! I swear on my mother's grave I got[N]
the right quota![A] My family has been tending[N]
this land for generations,[A] and never once[N]
have we missed our quota.[AN]
Even when a new Count Wolffia comes to[N]
power and the tribute quota increases,[AN]
we've always buckled down and worked harder[N]
to stay afloat.[AN]
Please, your lordliness. House Sarka is in[N]
charge of all the noble houses in Meraly.[AN]
For all of us, please tell Lord Sarka to[N]
do something about their abuses.[AN]
[L]Aha! Exactly right. House Sarka manages[N]
all noble and knightly affairs in Meraly,[AN]
so if any house's knights were so corrupt[N]
we'd know about it and take action.[AN]
Rest assured, if we discover that these[N]
knights are in fact embezzling wine,[AN]
they will be punished swiftly.[AN]
Of this you have my word.[AN]
[R]But I'm telling you of their[N]
corruption right here![A] Please, your[N]
lordliness, I'm begging you![AN]
My family can't live like this if the[N]
knights keep stealing our tribute.[AN]
You have to help us![AN]
[L]Ma'am, you have to calm down.[N]
All I'm saying is-[AN]
[FFR][LoadCrocodile]
[FFR]Yarr har ho! It seems this town be[N]
filled to the brim with fresh meat![AN]
[FL]Milord, it appears we have company.[AN]
[L]Indeed. Ma'am, I apologize to cut this[N]
short, but we have more pressing matters.[AN]
Return to your home and board it up; one[N]
of us will stop by to assist if necessary.[AN]
[R]Oh. Um, that won't be necessary.[AN]
Just finish this quickly, y'hear?[A][X]


## OverturePreparingToBattle
[ML][LoadKlaudia][R][LoadOmen][FR][LoadJosephine]
[ML]Omen, Josie, prepare for battle.[AN]
We'll show peasant and pirate alike[N]
the might of House Orsolle![AN]
[R]As you command. Let us make[N]
your lord father proud.[AN]
[FR]And so we fight on. Don't you[N]
dare make me die for you.[A][X]

## OvertureDevotiaIntroduction
Welcome all, ladies and gentlemen, to[N]
tonight's showing of Devotia Exhibition.[AN]
My name is Dragz, and I will be the[N]
stage manager for this production.[AN]

an original world and characters,[AN]
my first foray into Fire Emblem hacking[N]
and my passion project as of 4 months.[AN]
On full release Devotia will have 18[N]
man story chapters and 3 gaidens,[AN]
thought this demo currently only[N]
features the overture.[AN]
All audience members may consult the[N]
Playbill for mechanical information,[AN]
worldbuilding details, and credits for[N]
all the creatives and wizards at FEU[AN]
that made this project possible.[AN]
Lastly, if Klaudia or Levia falls in[N]
battle, you will receive a Game Over.[AN]
With all that said, relax, sit back,[N]
and enjoy Devotia Exhibition.[A][X]

## OvertureKlaudiaJosephineTalk
[ML][LoadKlaudia][MR][LoadJosephine]
[ML]Josie. Get into position on the vanguard.[AN]
Your role in this battle is to defend me[N]
from these dullards' attacks.[A] They won't[N]
even be able to dent your armor.[AN]
[MR]Oh, you're leaving me with you?[A] Joy.[AN]
Why can't Omen be on bodyguard duty[N]
for once?[A] He's your formal retainer,[N]
and he actually wants to be here.[AN]
[ML]Omen's versatility is better suited for[N]
going off on his own than guarding me.[AN]
If we're going to prevent these pirates[N]
from wreaking havoc on this village,[AN]
we must split up our forces strategically.[AN]
You do understand that, don't you?[AN]
Now then, ready your magic. I see enemies[N]
approaching just south of us.[AN]
[ML][ClearFace]
[MR][CloseEyes]Sigh. The sooner we finish this, the[N]
sooner we can go home, Josephine.[A][X]

## OvertureCamForeshadowing
[ML][LoadCam]
[ML]Seems there's some fighting[N]
going on up north.[AN]
Cap'n said this raid would be[N]
like taking candy from a babe,[AN]
but we all know we should've[N]
dropped anchor months ago.[AN]
Now that we're in a new frontier,[N]
it's time for me to jump ship...[A][X]

## OvertureCamRecruitmentKlaudia
[ML][LoadCam][MR][LoadKlaudia]
[ML]Oi, you there. You're the commander[N]
here, aren't ya? The name's Cam.[AN]
Who in the hells are you people?[AN]
[MR]We're the knights of House Orsolle.[AN]
If you've never heard of us, your[N]
ship must've sailed here from Drek.[AN]
Otherwise you'd know not to test the[N]
strength of Meralian knights.[AN]
[ML]Aye, it's true. Piracy in Drek's[N]
gotten harder the last few years.[AN]
The cap'n said a Meralian port town[N]
would be easy picking,[A] but he's not the[N]
sharpest tooth on the shark.[AN]
[MR]You'd really talk that way[N]
about a man you serve?[AN]
[ML]Serve? By the flow of the tides[N]
I won't be serving him anymore.[AN]
I want to join your crew, missy.[AN]
A proper seaman knows when she's been
beat. I want to fly the winning flag.[AN]
[MR]Hm. I usually don't trust anyone whose[N]
convictions are swayed so easily,[AN]
though I respect that you acknowledge[N]
the winning side in this battle.[AN]
[ML]I don't need you to trust me.[AN]
Strength is everything in this world,[N]
and I'm as strong as they come.[AN]
So long as ye don't pick a losing[N]
fight, me axe is yours to command.[AN]
[MR]Very well. Welcome aboard, Cam.[AN]
I'll show you why House Orsolle[N]
is the strongest there is![A][X]

## OvertureCamRecruitmentOmen
[ML][LoadCam][MR][LoadOmen]
[MR]Say your last prayers, wretch.[AN]
[ML] Oi! Hold it, hold it. I fly[N]
the white flag. The name's Cam.[AN]
[MR]Good. At least one of you has[N]
a head on their shoulders.[AN]
Now keep that head and get[N]
out of here while you can.[AN]
[ML]Hold it. That commander of yours -[N]
the redhead with the sorcery.[AN]
She's strong. I'd like to fight[N]
for her, if ye'll have me.[AN]
[MR]Don't presume to know anything about[N]
my lord.[A] For your own sake, I highly[N]
advise you reconsider.[AN]
[ML]A proper seaman knows no fear.[AN]
Your commander is strong, that's[N]
all the information I need.[AN]
Now, enough talk. The sea waits[N]
for no man.[AN]
[MR]Eloquently spoken. Your assistance[N]
here will be greatly appreciated.[AN]
I just recommend you temper your[N]
expectations for Lord Klaudia.[A][X]

## OvertureGiselleJoins
[ML][LoadGiselle]
[ML]Pirates? Ugh, what cowards.[AN]
If they're gonna steal to survive,[N]
taking from innocents isn't right.[AN]
I'll just have to show them that[N]
the hard way.[AN]
House Orsolle's knights showed[N]
up a little while ago...[AN]
I don't like it, but they're[N]
my best shot at winning this.[A][X]

## OvertureOmenGiselleTalk
[ML][LoadGiselle][MR][LoadOmen]
[MR]You, child. It's not safe on the streets.[N]
Get inside your home before you get hurt.[AN]
[ML]That's pretty damn obvious, Mister Mask.[AN]
But what the hell is someone as ragged as[N]
you doing skulking around a battlefield?[AN]
[MR]How my appearance is perceived by a[N]
child is irrelevant.[A] My duty here is to[N]
rout the pirates: that is all.[AN]
[Beat]You may put the knife away now.[AN]
[ML]'Preciate it, but I'd rather not. These[N]
are dangerous times we're living in.[AN]
[MR]Admittedly so, though I worry for your[N]
combat prowess with a build so scrawny.[AN]
[ML]Hm! I could give you a firsthand[N]
demonstration, if you'd like[Beat][AN]
[MR]Was that a threat? Tell[N]
me your name, child.[AN]
[ML]I thought it was rude to ask a stranger's[N]
name without giving yours first.[AN]
[MR][Beat]Omen. Advisor and retainer to House Orsolle.[AN]
[ML]Wow, aren't you a big shot, Mister Mask.[AN]
Name's Giselle, orphan and pickpocket.[N]
Pleased to meet'cha.[AN]
[MR]Now then, if you're so intent at[N]
ignoring warnings, come with us.[AN]
You'll be safer in our ranks.[AN]
[ML]Gotcha, but you're better off[N]
watching your own back.[AN]
Just try and keep up.[A][X]

## OvertureReinforcementsAppear
[MR][LoadCrocodile]
[MR]Oi, what's going on here?[N]
This village is bleeding dry![AN]
These blasted peasants are[N]
hiding all the gold from us![AN]
No matter, we just gotta burn[N]
their houses down to find it![AN]
Come up from below deck, lads,[N]
and pillage to ye heart's content![A][X]

## OvertureCrocodileMoves
[MR][LoadCrocodile]
[MR]Me mates are getting pounded[N]
by a bunch of piss knights?![AN]
Time I step in and show 'em why[N]
the croc is the king o' the sea![A][X]

## OvertureKnightBarracksOmen
[ML][LoadRedSoldier][MR][LoadCurrent]
[ML]Uhhhhhh... whosssere?[AN]
[MR]Omen Graviloqus, chief advisor to[N]
Lord Savitr Cornelius Orsolle himself.[AN]
I'm here on orders to resolve a dispute[N]
between the peasantry and deputy,[AN]
but our investigation is on hold due[N]
to a sudden pirate invasion.[AN]
If you value your chivalric duty,[N]
pick up your arms and join the fight...[AN]
[ML]Huh... y'say pirates?[AN]
Hey, you know I just this[N]
dream about a lady pirate.[AN]
She had HUGE musceles, huge enough[N]
to crush a man between them...[AN]
if you catch my drift, heh heh.[AN]
I-I think I'm gonna go see her[N]
again now. Goodnight.[AN]
[ML][ClearFace]
[MR][MoL]
[L]...though I didn't expect[N]
as much from any of you.[AN]
Pathetic. I should confiscate[N]
some arms while I'm here,[AN]
lest they facilitate an[N]
unfortunate... accident.[A][X]

## OvertureOmenReflecting
[ML][LoadOmen]
[ML]Klaudia won't be pleased[N]
to hear this report. [CloseEyes]Sigh.[AN]
I need to work off some steam.[OpenEyes][AN]
Gutting the throats of a few[N]
pirates should do the trick,[AN]
they might have made camp in[N]
that clearing on the beach.[A][X]

## OvertureKnightBarracksKlaudia
[ML][LoadRedSoldier][MR][LoadCurrent]
[MR]Knights! My name is Klaudia Orsolle, I[N]
was sent here by order of House Sarka.[AN]
We're currently fending off a band of[N]
pirates and could use some backup.[AN]
[ML]Urghhh. Not so loud.[N]
My head is pounding.[AN]
[MR]What the-?[MoR] You're drinking on duty![AN]
Not just that, this wine was supposed[N]
to be turned in to Sarka as tribute.[AN]
Hells, you were embezzling it the[N]
entire time.[A] You're a disgrace to[N]
the very institution of knighthood.[AN]
When we return to Sarka, I'll see[N]
you personally stripped of your post.[AN]
[ML]You what know? Heeeey, didn't you[N]
know I'm a knight of Meraly?[AN]
I'm untouchable! W-Wait, who did[N]
you say you were?[A] This has to[N]
be a dream, I'm going back to bed.[AN]
[ML][ClearFace]
[MR][MoL]
[L]Hey! Wake up! I'm not[N]
done with you yet![AN]
[Beat]It't no use, he's[N]
already fast asleep.[AN]
There's so many bottles[N]
of wine scattered here.[AN]
This corruption must've[N]
been ongoing for a long time.[AN]
Lord Fernyiges will want[N]
to know about this,[AN]
I should take a bottle[N]
back with me as evidence.[A][X]

## OvertureMovementVillage
[FL][LoadCurrent][L][LoadStorchsDad][R][LoadGenericMan][FR][LoadYoungBoy]
[L]I'm telling you, speed is the most[N]
important parameter in combat![AN]
[R]Nuh-uh! Speed is worthless if you[N]
can't even reach the enemy.[AN]
That's why movement is so much[N]
more important to succeed.[AN]
[FR]Um, I don't understand. What's the[N]
difference between speed and movement?[AN]
They sound the same to me.[AN]
[L]It's extremely simple, son. Movement is[N]
how far you can go before getting tired.[AN]
Speed is how fast you move within combat.[AN]
[FR]I get that, by why is how far you can move[N]
without getting tired called [O"]movement[C"]?[AN]
Wouldn't constitution be a better word?[AN]
[R]That's an entirely different thing, son.[AN]
Constitution is how heavy of weapons you[N]
can wield without getting weighed down.[AN]
Not related to movement at all.[AN]
[FR]Wait, but that's not constitution![N]
You're just describing your strength![AN]
[L]Didn't they teach you this in school?[AN]
Strength affects how much you harm your[N]
opponent in combat,[A] it's the most basic[N]
combat concept imaginable.[AN]
[FR]Then if strength is so basic, why is it[N]
not the most important stat of combat?[AN]
[L]You'll understand when you're older, son.[N]
This discussion is for grown-ups only.[AN]
[FR][ClearFace][L][ClearFace][FR][LoadStorchsDad]
[FR]Oh. You're knights from Orsolle, right?[N]
I'm sure you want a reward for warning us.[AN]
Honey, what can we give these kind souls?[AN]
[R]We have a spare Sarka Necklace around here.[N]
I'm uh, sure it will be of great use to them.[AN]
After all, don't we all know that luck is[N]
the most important stat in combat?[A][X]

## OvertureSamilVillage
[MR][LoadSamil][ML][LoadCurrent]
[MR]Hail, visitor. Care for a fortune telling?[AN]
Should you not strive to change your fate,[N]
who knows what tragedy may befall you.[AN]
[ML]I appreciate the offer, but we're[N]
in the middle of battle right now.[AN]
[MR]Please, indulge me for but a brief reading.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Yes, I see[Beat] Oh, this is[Beat][N]
This is bad. This is very bad.[OpenEyes][AN]
[ML]What do you see?[AN]
[MR]I see two cards: War, upright, and[N]
Wisdom, inverted.[A] Blood spilling as[N]
easily as ink on a page.[AN]
The combination is most associated with[N]
foolhardy army commanders, skilled in[AN]
combat but doomed by their failure to[N]
make the right choices.[A] The Wisdom[N]
card is also positioned laterally,[AN]
which implies it has a literal[N]
meaning as well as symbolic.[AN]
Blood will be spilled within a hall[N]
of knowledge, perhaps a library.[AN]
[ML]Look, I appreciated this reading,[N]
but I don't believe in fortune telling.[AN]
[MR]Of course, my apologies for keeping[N]
you from the battle at hand.[A] Oh, one[N]
last thing. Before you leave, take this.[AN]
If you don't believe my readings, try[N]
wearing it in combat.[A] Now farewell,[N]
the winds of fate call for me as well.[A][X]

I'm Ematare Sagluz, you can call me Ema.[AN]
[ML]It's nice to meet you, Ema, but why have[N]
you been waiting so long to meet me?[AN]
[MR]Well... the truth is, I've[N]

If I exhaust myself too much,[AN]
I go into a coughing fit and[N]

[CloseEyes]The apothecaries told my[N]

[ML][CloseEyes]I'm very sorry to hear that. Go on.[OpenEyes][AN]
[MR]My parents don't have any other children.[AN]
But with my condition, I can't hold a sword[N]

My only hope is to study at Orsolle's magic[N]
academy and find a cure for my condition.[AN]
But we're poor and aren't able to hire[N]
a tutor, so I won't be able to get in.[AN]
Milord, if you could just take a few[N]
