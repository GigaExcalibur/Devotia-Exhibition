[ML]Josie.[AN]
[MR]Klaudia. I thought I told you[N]
not to call me any nicknames.[AN]
[ML]And I thought I told you to

[MR]Ah, If it isn't Carina![N]
To what do I owe the pleasure?[AN]
[ML]Isn't it obvious?[A] You were just[N]
coughing blood, I came here to check.[AN]
What happened to you?[AN]
[MR]Oh, is that all?[A] It happens sometimes,[N]
you don't need to lose sleep over it.[AN]
[ML]Those dark circles under your eyes...[N]
you are not feeding yourself right.[AN]
[MR]You didn't earn your title for nothing![AN]
Very sharp, but as I'm sure you know,[N]
there are more pressing matters at hand.[AN]
A well-aimed arrow shot will kill me[N]
far quicker than a poor diet.[AN]
[ML]Even so, if you don't take care of your body,[N]
you'll only make things harder for yourself.[AN]
[MR]Hmm... you do make a fair point.[AN]
However, have you ever noticed a weak enemy[N]
suddenly release a very deadly attack?[AN]
[ML]Well... yes, I've seen how utterly[N]
devastating those attacks can be.[AN]
Most can barely hold themselves[N]
together after such a powerful blow.[AN]
[MR]Now then, what would you do if you saw[N]
an ally take such a deadly attack?[AN]
Is there any reason to waste a precious[N]
charge of your staff to heal them?[AN]
[ML]That's not fair Alma, and you know it.[AN]
As a healer I wouldn't give up on someone[N]
so easily, no matter how desperate![AN]
[MR]Carina, there's no such thing as[N]
an easy answer to curing death.[AN]
Fate likes to take far more than to give.[AN]
The next soul they take could be me,[N]
you, or someone you love dearly.[AN]
[ML]H-huh? Why are you telling me this?[AN]
[MR]Oh, nothing![A] Just the ramblings[N]
of a worried man, don't mind me.[AN]
Well, it's right about time I had a drink.[AN]
I appreciate your concern Carina,[N]
thank you for the talk, and farewell.[AN]
[MR][ClearFace]
[ML]What was he going on about?[AN]
I know fate can be cruel, but...[N]
Am I taking this war too lightly?[AN]
No, I've been worried every single minute.[AN]
Ugh, I need a healing spell for this[N]
headache he just gave me...[A][X]

[ML]Alma! There you are, I've been looking[N]
all over for you.[A] We need to talk.[AN]
[MR]Carina, please, no more attention,[N]
if you don't stop, I'll start blushing![AN]
[ML]I'm being serious! I just need[N]
a few minutes of your time.[AN]
[MR]Well now! If you're that serious,[N]
I'll go ask Klaudia a little favor.[AN]
Maybe she can spare us a quick break![AN]
[ML]Alma! Please listen![AN]
[MR]...You're worried for me again,[N]
aren't you? My apologies.[AN]
[ML]Yes, you've got me all figured out.[N]
Think of this as a health check-up.[AN]
Answer this question with full honesty:[N]
Are you taking proper care of yourself?[AN]
[MR]Is there any particular reason[N] 
as to why you care so much?[AN]
As I'm sure I've told you before,[N]
there are better uses of your time.[AN]
[ML]I don't need any [O"]particular reason[C"][N]
to not want you to throw your life away![AN]
Those dark circles deepen every day![AN]
You said death can take us any moment,[N]
but you make it easy for the reaper![AN]
[MR]Carina! Please do calm yourself.[AN]
You're right, my condition is quite dire,[N]
and I'm close to death in this state.[AN]
However, I don't plan on simply[N]
dropping dead at the flip of a coin.[AN]
[ML]But why, Alma?! If you're dying,[N]
please just let me heal you![AN]
[MR]Whyever stress over it?[AN]
Are you worried for my own health?[AN]
Or are you simply too paranoid to have[N]
an ally's death on your conscience?[AN]
[ML][Beat]
[MR]...Listen, I did not mean to harm[N]
you with what I said the other day.[AN]
The opposite, in fact.[A] Death is inevitable,[N]
Carina, and its weight is not on you.[AN]
[ML]Alma...[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]Inevitable... you can't escape death.[OpenEyes][N]
But, it is quite possible to reverse it.[AN]
[ML]Do you mean... cheating death?[N]
Is that something you're capable of?[AN]
[MR]Oh, I wouldn't call it cheating.[AN]
I plan to fix an error that deprived[N]
this world of a most beautiful soul.[AN]
Staying quite close to death makes[N]
it easier to toy with, in my opinion.[AN]
[ML]Alma, I don't think that this is right.[AN]
[MR]Why wouldn't it be?[A] I'm sure[N]
there are natural laws I'm tattering,[AN]
but a thief who steals from a thief[N]
earns 100 years of forgiveness.[AN]
[ML]B-but you're hurting yourself Alma![AN]
What if you die before you accomplish[N]
anything?[A] Would it be worth it then?[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]Hm... I thought you'd understand,[N]
since you despise death, but alas.[AN]
We shouldn't converse much further.[N]
Don't worry about me... I urge you.[AN]
[MR][ClearFace]
[ML]Alma, wait![A][CloseEyes] I shouldn't have said[N]
that...[OpenEyes] but, I don't want him to die.[AN]
No, this isn't about death anymore...[N]
I can't stand by and watch him suffer.[A][X]
