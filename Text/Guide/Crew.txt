I've had a passing interest in[N]
Fire Emblem romhacking for a[N]
few months before I started[N]
Devotia, but was never able[N]
to find a motivation to start[N]
working on a project.[N]
But then FEE3 2022 happened,[N]
and I was blown away by the[N]
quality of the hacks showcased[N]
and the community surrounding[N]
them all.[N]
[N]
I was geeking out about these[N]
hacks to my friends in a[N]
Discord server Off the String.[N]
One of them suggested offhand[N]
that the server collaborate[N]
on a hack of our own, a[N]
suggestion that was just what[N]
I needed to want to begin the[N]
project. I excitedly pitched[N]
the story idea, everyone loved[N]
it, and we started workshopping[N]
character ideas to fill out our[N]
cast.[N]
[N]
This section of the playbill is[N]
dedicated to each Devotia team[N]
member and their personal[N]
contributions to the hack.[X]
